\begin{block}{\texttt{ieval}}
\texttt{ieval} will simply evaluate the provided
string/sexp as emacs lisp code. You
must provide \texttt{ieval} with, firstly, the preceding
code, which may be, for example, a function
definition or package requires, etc. and,
secondly, evaluated expression. Either
argument can either be a raw string containing
code or a sexp, but the expression will be
"one-line-ized" for the prompt.
