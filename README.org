**** hippocampus
- The hippocampus is vital for episodic memory.
- Probably also vital for imagination.

If memory works as a reconstructive process
then if we think about imagination as being a
similar process but in this case it's a
constructive process if we think of memory as
trying to put your components that you have
together in a way that your brain thinks
looks and judges as familiar perhaps
creativity's that is the converse of that
you're still bringing together those
components but now you're trying to create
something novel that actually your brain
judges as unfamiliar so I was thinking well
if memory is heavily dependent on the
hippocampus then maybe imagination is also a
very heavily dependent on the same brain
structure and the same processes.
