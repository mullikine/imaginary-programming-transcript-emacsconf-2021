* Simulacra and Science Fiction
Jean Baudrillard speaks about the gap
between the real and the imaginary.

We no longer imagine a world radically
different from the real one, but
rather a world that's a mere expansion
of the real one.

In the postmodern society the gap
between the real and the imaginary
disappears completely, and we are no
longer capable of ideal projections
(of imagining new worlds).
    
We can only imagine mere
reconfigurations of our world, or
simply relive the ideal projections of
past times.

  imaginary reality
  paracosm
      The distinction between this and virtual
      reality is that virtual reality isn't
      really concerned so much with Neural
      Networks for a lazily generated potential
      reality that is constructed as one's own
      mind prompts another.
      
      Also virtual reality is engineered for
      people to explore where imaginary reality
      is generated at will by a user and does
      not follow rules.
      
      Imaginary reality takes place within a
      walled garden of a single mind /
      imagination forming around another.
      
      The interpretation of the output of one
      mind/neural net as have been sensed and
      interpreted by another mind / Neural
      Network, in real time.

  pure imaginary reality
      This is one's personal introspective
      experience of their own imagination.
