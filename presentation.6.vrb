An \texttt{NFT} is like a trading card, or piece of media that is part of the blockchain web.

For example, \texttt{Mickey Mouse} now exists as an
\texttt{iNFT}. We have consensus over Mickey's image
and personality.

An \texttt{iNTF}, however, also contains a prompt and associated language model, which is intended to interpret the prompt.

To understand what a prompt is, please see my
previous presentation, or read "Pretrain,
Prompt and Predict".
