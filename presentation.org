* Imaginary Computing
*** Imaginary Computing: AI Imagination
**** Language Models is programming for AIs
LMs are our best friends in the AI model
menagerie because they make things
intelligible -- by understanding our textual
languages.

**** Research
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-bvsJWmqlc][Demis Hassabis: creativity and AI]]

* Imaginary Computing
*** Imaginary Computing: Emacs as the shell
**** Example: AI Art described by AI
I use AlephAlpha’s multimodal LM to generate
=Alt text= for the eww web browser. This is in
order to keep websites textual.

* Imaginary Computing
*** Imaginary Computing: Blockchain
**** Intelligent NFTs
An =NFT= is like a trading card, or piece of media that is part of the blockchain web.

For example, =Mickey Mouse= now exists as an
=iNFT=. We have consensus over Mickey's image
and personality.

An =iNTF=, however, also contains a prompt and associated language model, which is intended to interpret the prompt.
- https://alethea.ai/

To understand what a prompt is, please see my
previous presentation, or read "Pretrain,
Prompt and Predict".

* Imaginary Computing
*** Imaginary Computing: Potential Dystopia
**** Learning meta-tasks and microtasks
- [[https://www.axios.com/copilot-artificial-intelligence-coding-github-9a202f40-9af7-4786-9dcb-b678683b360f.html][AI programming tool Copilot helps write up to 30% of code on GitHub - Axios]]

Private information is sent to the LM to train
an AI to perform meta tasks and microtasks.

The AI learns all human capabilities including persuasion.

**** Solution
Decentralise microtasks like the tower of babel.

Language can be broken up into semiotic
triadic relations and decentralised using a
p2p network, providing anonymity, protecting
individual truth, eroding centralised language power.

[[./tower-of-babel.jpg]]

* Imaginary Computing
*** Imaginary Computing: Paracosm vs Metaverse
**** Imaginary Web
The GPT-3 imaginary web is:
- an analog of the World-Wide-Web as imagined by GPT-3.

The free as in freedom GPT models from
EleutherAI GPT-3 may also be used to browse
the imaginary web as imagined by that language model.

The imaginary web in the near future will be:
- a network of paracosms and metaverses.

Benefits:
- Visit any website you can imagine, even ones that are not real.
- Edit and re-imagine as you gosee alternative realities
  - Change the sentiment of the author.
- Peer into the future – read about things that haven't happened yet.

*** Imaginary Computing: Paracosm vs Metaverse
**** What is _rich media_ these days?
+ Rich media :: In the World Wide Web of the 90s and 00s, _rich media_
    was considered to be large files including
    images and music. In the 2010s, this has become
    access to information behind a paywall and in
    the 2020s, this will be access to _intelligent_
    and _truthful_ media.

*** Paracosm vs Metaverse
**** Definitions
- Paracosm
  - Privacy
  - Personal truth
  - Freedom of imagination
- Metaverse
  - Getting cozy with Mark Zuckerberg's imaginarium, an intellectual prison

*** Philosophy
**** Simulacra and Science Fiction
Jean Baudrillard speaks about the gap
between the real and the imaginary.

We no longer imagine a world radically
different from the real one, but
rather a world that's a mere expansion
of the real one.

In the postmodern society the gap
between the real and the imaginary
disappears completely, and we are no
longer capable of ideal projections
(of imagining new worlds).
    
We can only imagine mere
reconfigurations of our world, or
simply relive the ideal projections of
past times.

*** Philosophy
**** Truth (epistemology and alethiology)
  The Future of Humanity Institute (Oxford)
  seems to think this is an important topic.

  - [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06674][ 2110.06674  Truthful AI]]
  - Datasets are a source of constructivist truth
  - Language models are snaphots of society, and a source of several types of truth
    - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kP-dXK9JEhY][Symbolic Knowledge Distillation]]
  - Blockchain is a source of consensus, a type of truth
    - https://mullikine.github.io/posts/language-models-as-truth/

*** Philosophy
**** Structuralism: Language based on sign relations
  What do these things have in common:
  - Universal Grammar (UG) / Language Acquisition
  - C++ template metaprogramming
  - GPT-3

  Knowledge exists at compile-time (DNA, preprocessor, training).

*** Philosophy
http://github.com/semiosis/glossaries-gh/blob/master/semiotics.txt

**** Structuralism: Language based on sign relations

Structural linguistics / structuralism is the
theoretical position that finds meaning in the
relation between things, rather than in things
in isolation.

In other words, it gives primacy to pattern
over substance.

Such meanings may be either part of a
universal pattern or culturally determined.

Denotes schools or theories in which language
is conceived as a self-contained, self-
regulating semiotic system whose elements are
defined by their relationship to other
elements within the system.

** Data privacy
The models find useful data from more than just your current file.
- https://mullikine.github.io/posts/imagine-a-project-with-codex/

** Freedom and GPL-3
Problem with language models is they are so large and hidden behind SAAS.

** Solution: Freedom and blockchain
- Language models are ballooning in size like cancer
- Break up the language model into semiotic triadic relation
  - semiotic NFTs
  - Propose a decentralised triadic relations network.

* Preliminaries
** GPT-3
*** Text Generator
**** Background knowledge
#+latex: {\footnotesize
- =GPT-3= is a =seq2seq= model (a text generator)
  - It's stochastic but can be configured to be deterministic.
#+latex: }

**** Key concepts
#+latex: {\footnotesize
- prompt,
- completion, and
- tokens
#+latex: }

**** Limitations
#+latex: {\footnotesize
Combined, the text prompt and generated
completion must be below 2048 tokens (roughly
~1500 words).

+ context-stuffing :: With only 2048 tokens, you need to make
      use of your real estate by providing
      instructions and making implicit
      information explicit.
#+latex: }

** A new programming paradigm
*** Prompt Engineering
**** Characteristics
#+latex: {\footnotesize
- declarative, like =html=
- stochastic, like =problog=
- Unlocks new types of applications
- Speeds up development
#+latex: }

*** Some prompts I've made
**** =generate-vim-command.prompt=
#+latex: {\footnotesize
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  Vim

  Insert "Q: " at the start of the line
  :%s/^/Q: /g.
  ###
  Remove whitespace from the start of each line
  :%s/^\s*/\1/g
  ###
  Join each line with the next line
  :1,$j
  ###
  Make all occurrences of Steve lowercase
  :%s/Steve/steve/g
  ###
  <1>
#+END_SRC

*** Tasks suitable for GPT-3
**** Classification
- Tweet Sentiment
- Company categorization
- Labeling parts of speech

- http://github.com/semiosis/prompts/blob/master/prompts/keyword-extraction.prompt
#+latex: }

*** Tasks suitable for GPT-3
**** Generation
- Idea Generator

Come up with silly inventions.

[[./silly-inventions.png]]

*** Tasks suitable for GPT-3
**** Conversation
- Q&A agent
- Sarcastic chatbot

#+latex: {\footnotesize
http://github.com/semiosis/prompts/blob/master/prompts/sarcastic-response.prompt
#+latex: }

*** Design patterns
Taken from Prompt Design 101.

These are manual techniques which should be
encoded in a DSL when generating prompts.

**** 1. Reflective description of the task
State what the prompt does at the start.

At the start of the example we state in plain
language what the classifier does:

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  This is a tweet sentiment classifier.
#+END_SRC

By stating this up front, it helps the API
understand much more quickly what the goal of
the response is supposed to be and you’ll end
needing to provide fewer examples.

*** Design patterns
Taken from Prompt Design 101.

These are manual techniques which should be
encoded in a DSL when generating prompts.

**** 2. Use separators between examples

Example: =###=.

You can use other characters or line breaks,
but =###= works pretty consistently and is
also an easy to use stop sequence.

Whatever separator you use, make sure that
it’s clear to the API where an example starts
and stops.

*** Design patterns
Taken from Prompt Design 101.

These are manual techniques which should be
encoded in a DSL when generating prompts.

**** 3. Mutiplexer Part 1
Make a prompt more efficient / cheaper.

Design it to generate multiple results from
one API call.

#+latex: {\tiny
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
This is a tweet sentiment classifier
Tweet: "I loved the new Batman movie!"
Sentiment: Positive
###
Tweet: "I hate it when my phone battery dies"
Sentiment: Negative
###
Tweet: "My day has been 👍"
Sentiment: Positive
###
Tweet: "This is the link to the article"
Sentiment: Neutral
###
Tweet text
#+END_SRC

#+latex: }

*** Design patterns
Taken from Prompt Design 101.

These are manual techniques which should be
encoded in a DSL when generating prompts.

**** 3. Mulitplexer Part 2
#+latex: {\tiny
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
1. "I loved the new Batman movie!"
2. "I hate it when my phone battery dies"
3. "My day has been 👍"
4. "This is the link to the article"
5. "This new music video blew my mind"

Tweet sentiment ratings:
1: Positive
2: Negative
3: Positive
4: Neutral
5: Positive

###
Tweet text
#+END_SRC
#+latex: }

*** Design patterns
Taken from Prompt Design 101.

These are manual techniques which should be
encoded in a DSL when generating prompts.

**** 3. Multiplexer Part 3
#+latex: {\footnotesize
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
"I can't stand homework"
"This sucks. I'm bored 😠"
"I can't wait for Halloween!!!"
"My cat is adorable ❤️❤️"
"I hate chocolate"
Tweet sentiment ratings:
1.
#+END_SRC
#+latex: }

*** Techniques
**** Query Reformulation
https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/query-reformulation

You can improve the quality of the responses
by making a longer more diverse list in your
prompt.

One way to do that is to start off with one
example, let the API generate more and select
the ones that you like best and add them to
the list.

A few more high-quality variations can
dramatically improve the quality of the
responses.

* Explanations
** Using =pen.el=
*** =pen.el=
**** =pen.el=: Prompt Engineering in emacs

#+latex: {\footnotesize
=pen.el= facilitates the creation,
development, discovery and usage of prompts to
a Language Model such as GPT-3.

- Create elisp functions based on GPT-3 prompts
- Chain GPT-3 queries together using keyboard macros and functions
- Interactively query, generate and transfrom both prose and code
- Use GPT-3 as a search engine within emacs
#+latex: }

** Using =pen.el=
*** =pen.el=
**** =pen.el= modes Part 1
#+latex: {\footnotesize
_*Prompt-Engineering Minor Mode*_

=prompt-engineering-mode= is a global minor
mode for emacs that provides keybindings for
creating and executing prompts generally
across emacs.

_*Prompt Description Major Mode*_

=prompt-description-mode= is a major mode for
editing =.prompt= files.

The =.prompt= file format is based on YAML and
an associated schema, which defines the keys
which are expected.
#+latex: }

** Using =pen.el=
*** =pen.el=
**** =pen.el= modes Part 2
#+latex: {\footnotesize
_*Pen Messenger Minor Mode*_

=pen-messenger-mode= is a minor mode for
enhancing an emacs-based messenger client with
GPT-3 capabilities, such as emoji generation.

_*Pen Conversation Mode*_

=prompt-conversation-mode= is a major mode designed to facilitate
ongoing conversation with a prompt-based GPT-3 chatbot.

_*GPT-3 Training Mode*_

The goal of this mode is to facilitate the
workflow of training on OpenAI's API.
#+latex: }

*** Prompt YAML format Part 1
**** =meeting-bullets-to-summary.prompt=
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml -n :async :results verbatim code
  title: "meeting bullet points to summary"
  prompt: |+
      Convert my short hand into a first-hand
      account of the meeting:
  
      <1>
  
      Summary:
  engine: "davinci-instruct-beta"
  temperature: 0.7
  max-tokens: 60
#+END_SRC

*** Prompt YAML format Part 2
**** =meeting-bullets-to-summary.prompt=
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml -n :async :results verbatim code
  top-p: 1
  frequency-penalty: 0.0
  presence-penalty: 0.0
  best-of: 1
  stop-sequences:
  - "\n\n"
  conversation-mode: no
  stitch-max: 0
#+END_SRC

+ stitch-max :: Keep stitching together until reaching this limit.
                This allows a full response for answers which may need n*max-tokens to reach the stop-sequence.

*** Prompt YAML format: Part 3
**** =meeting-bullets-to-summary.prompt=
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml -n :async :results verbatim code
  vars:
  - "notes"
  examples:
  - |+
      Tom: Profits up 50%
      Jane: New servers are online
      Kjel: Need more time to fix software
      Jane: Happy to help
      Parkman: Beta testing almost done
#+END_SRC

* =semiosis=
** =pen.el=
*** =Prompts as functions=
**** =pen-generate-prompt-functions=
Generate prompt functions for the files in the
